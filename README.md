# Discord Game Activity Simulator

> Discord Quest Completer, Discord Rich Presence Simulator whatever. I don't know what to call this.

A lightweight desktop application that simulates Discord Rich Presence for games without requiring installation of the actual games. Perfect for completing Discord Quests and showing off your gaming status without the storage burden.

## Installation

> No instructions yet. Can't build from source yet. I will add this later and setup automation to release pre-built binaries.

## Features

- Simulate playing verified Discord games without installation
- Complete Discord Quests requiring 15-minute gameplay (not yet tested for Stream the game Quests)
- Accessible for users without high-end gaming PCs
- Only Discord Verified games are supported

## How It Works

This app creates small executable files that mimic the actual game processes that Discord looks for when detecting a verified game to use it for it's Rich Presence activity. When launched/played, the tiny executables trigger Discord's Rich Presence detection while consuming minimal system resources.

There is also an experimental discord RPC functionality, it connects to Discord's RPC Gateway to send Activity updates for the selected game using its App ID even if the game is not running. Though this is functional, this may not be the intended use of Discord's RPC and may violate their terms of service (may be under _self-botting_) and can put your Discord account at risk. Use this feature at your own risk.

## Use Cases

- Complete Discord Quests without downloading massive game files
- Show off playing the latest games to friends
- Save disk space while still participating in Discord's gaming ecosystem
- Useful for users with limited internet bandwidth or storage space

## Planned Features and fixes

- Make the "Stop" button work again if process was terminated outside of app's control.
- Save added games to a list for easy access
- Uninstall / Clean the installed dummy game runners.
- Discord Activity Simulator/playground (Customize and preview rich presence for developers and custom activities)
- Set custom activity status from supported games
- Linux and MacOS support (if possible)


## Supported Platforms

- Windows 11 (not yet tested on Windows 10 but it should work)

## Linux and MacOS support ?

Currently only Windows is supported. But I will try to add Linux support. I don't have a MacOS machine to test on so MacOS support is not gonna happen.

The reason for not having Linux and MacOS support right is that I want to make sure that the dummy game runner have minimal size like around 100KB or less for each platforms. For Windows on example, I used Rust and `windows` crate to use Win32 API to create a dummy window, this compiles to a small 136KB executable. I also tried a C# .net app which is fantastically small its only 7KB but can't make it to where Discord can detect it.

For Linux, I don't know where to start yet. I will try to explore more of what to use and make sure the runner binary is small and it's a pain (Wine, Proton, etc. How does discord detection work in linux. LMAO same for MacOS)

## TechStack

- Tauri
- Rust
- Vue.js

## Development Setup

### Recommended IDE Setup

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) + [Tauri](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tauri-apps.tauri-vscode) + [rust-analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer)

### Requirements

- Tauri - make sure the [pre-requisites](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites/) are installed such as Rust.
- NodeJS - use any that is latest or node 20+
- pnpm - project uses pnpm as package manager for the frontend.

### Development

Install dependencies for the Vue.js frontend using pnpm

```bash
pnpm install
```

Then run the Tauri dev command to start the development server. 

```bash
pnpm tauri dev
```

- Also make sure to copy the dummy game binary from `src-win` to the `src-tauri/target/release` and `src-tauri/target/debug` folder. This is where the Tauri app will look for the dummy game runner to run.

For the `src-win` the runner (dummy game):

```bash
cd src-win  
# Make a release build
cargo build --release
# Debug build
cargo build

# Copy the dummy game runner to the tauri target folder, the Tauri app needs this executable to run the dummy game.
cp target/release/src-win.exe ../src-tauri/target/release/template.exe
cp target/debug/src-win.exe ../src-tauri/target/debug/template.exe
```
